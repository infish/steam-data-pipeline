# Changelog

This file records user-visible changes to the Steam data pipeline.

## 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- The scheduler now waits for the configured run time in absolute time, so
  the daily run no longer fires an hour late after the spring DST change or an
  hour early after the autumn change.

### Removed

- Deleted the unused `db/init/01_create_dashboard_user.sh`; the dashboard
  account is created by the `db-bootstrap` service.

### Changed

- Aligned both GitHub workflows on `actions/checkout@v7` and removed the
  leftover `refactor/production-ready` branch trigger from the test workflow.
- Corrected the README project tree.

## 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- Replaced misleading SteamSpy `ccu` trend charts with current-player
  observations from Valve's top-100 concurrent-player feed.
- Added direct Valve player lookups for configured tracked games outside the
  top 100 and retained focused Steam review measurements.
- Recorded Valve's source measurement timestamp where available, separately
  from pipeline collection time.
- Removed legacy SteamSpy snapshots from dashboard charts. They remain stored
  and queryable for audit purposes without being presented as fresh data.
- Removed SteamSpy `ccu` fields from the dashboard's regular analysis tables
  and SQL examples; the raw historical column remains available for audit.
- Removed stale SteamSpy review and price summaries from regular dashboard
  analyses and limited the in-dashboard SQL Explorer to current operational,
  catalog, and Valve measurement objects.
- Expanded current-player coverage to catalog games present in Valve's top-100
  response; 7 Days to Die now uses Valve data rather than the frozen SteamSpy
  value.
- Disabled the duplicate user systemd timer so the Compose scheduler is the
  sole daily scheduler.

### Changed

- The dashboard's activity ranking and headline player count now use Valve
  measurements.
- Review metrics appear only for games with collected Steam review summaries.
- Added migration `V3__expand_valve_player_measurements.sql` to support player
  rank and player-only observations.
- Documented the stale-data incident, timestamp semantics, source coverage, and
  single-scheduler requirement.

## 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- Added initial Valve current-player and review measurements for Counter-Strike,
  Factorio, and Portal 2 after confirming SteamSpy's bulk and per-app values
  were stale.
- Labeled existing SteamSpy metrics and collection timestamps accurately.
- Disabled pipeline collection on scheduler startup and added deadline
  rechecking to prevent early-wakeup duplicate runs.
- Added freshness warnings for three identical consecutive Valve observations.

### Added

- Added migration `V2__steam_measurements.sql` and the
  `steam_game_measurements` table without deleting or rewriting historical
  snapshots.
